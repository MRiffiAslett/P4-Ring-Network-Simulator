# P4 Ring Topology Demo

This repository demonstrates a **ring-based topology** using the P4 language and the bmv2 reference switch (via the `p4app` environment). 

## Features

- **Custom Data Plane**: We use a match-action table to forward packets in a ring.
- **CLI-based Table Population**: Each switch has its own commands file (`commands_s1.txt`, etc.) to specify forwarding rules.
- **Mininet-like Setup**: `p4app.json` describes the network of 3 hosts and 3 P4 switches.

## Requirements

- [p4lang/p4app](https://github.com/p4lang/p4app)  
  (Install via `pip install p4app` or from source)
- Python 3

## Customization

- **Add More Switches**: You can extend the ring to 4 or more switches in `p4app.json` and adjust your P4 table rules.
- **Use a Tree Instead of a Ring**: Modify the topology and the CLI commands to create a tree-based approach for different forwarding logic (like parent-child relationships).
- **Expand the Data Plane**: Add more sophisticated packet processing, header modifications, or even a register-based approach in P4.

## Further Steps

- **Experiment with Measurements**: Add scripts to measure ping latency or throughput. 
- **FPGA or Tofino**: Once you're comfortable with the software switch, you can port the same P4 code to real hardware that supports P4 or an FPGA-based NIC. 
- **Integrate with ML**: In a real system, you might have ML processes sending gradient updates, which the data plane routes in a ring or tree for efficient allreduce.
